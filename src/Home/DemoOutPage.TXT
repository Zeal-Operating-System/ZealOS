                     The Temple Operating System

ZenithOS File Downloads (100% Public Domain)

ZenithOS is a free, public domain, open source, x86_64, non-preemptive 
multi-tasking, multi-cored, ring-0-only, single-address-map 
(identity-mapped), non-networked, PC operating system.  Paging is, 
basically, not used.

The CIA obsfucates to foil India, China, Russia and Korea.  They make 
things more complicated than necessary.  ZenithOS is more simple than 
necessary.  It is obnoxiously simple.  If you look at this 
"Hello World" joke, you can see why I capped the line count of 
TempleOS at 100,000.

God said TempleOS must be perfect, so backward compatibility is not 
promised.

I, Terry Davis, wrote all 80,849 lines of TempleOS over the last 16.5 
years, including the 64-bit compiler.  I have been a professional 
operating system developer since 1990 when I worked on Ticketmaster's 
VAX OS.
